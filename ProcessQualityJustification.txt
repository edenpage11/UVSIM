Product Quality Justification Document
Project: UVSim Educational Software
Date: 11/12/2023

Introduction:
    This document justifies the product quality of the UVSim Educational Software using
    two key compliance and improvement metrics: Adherence to Coding Standards and
    Bug Fix Turnaround Time.

1. Adherence to Coding Standards:
    With a pylint rating of 2.65/10(with negative scores possible) there are quite a few
    improvements to be made many of witch will be easy to add. With small changes our
    score will greatly improve and the code will better follow the established standards,
    ensuring consistency and maintainability.

2. Bug Fix Turnaround Time:
    Bug fix turnaround time measures how quickly our team identifies, addresses, and
    resolves found issues or bugs. On average, we resolve these bugs within 1-2 days to try
    to minimize any bigger code changes as a result of a missed bug.

3. Code Comment Density:
    The comment density metric evaluates the proportion of code accompanied by comments.
    As of the latest assessment, the UVSim Educational Software file main.py exhibits a comment density
    of approximately 26.3%. "Comment Density = (Number of comment lines/Total number of lines)*100" 
    High comment density signifies effective code documentation, enhancing code comprehension
    and overall quality.

Justification for Product Quality:
    The combination of a potentially higher adherence to coding standards and efficient
    bug fix turnaround time justifies the product quality of the UVSim Educational Software.
    While refactoring code is necessary, scrapping large portions of the prototype or
    restarting completely is not necessary.
