Functional requirement:

-The emulator should be able to load and execute BasicML programs.
-display registers and memory in gui. 
-input area will be open when inputing, and closed when running.
-Clearly explains how commands should be formatted.
-user can step through or run all lines of code.
-refactor functions to be classes with max 5 attributes, 10 methods, 5 couplings.
-Users need a button to click to execute their command (a “run” button)
-Displays lines of code being executed 

Non-functional requirement:

-User Friendly: The GUI should have an intuitive design that guides users on how to interact with the emulator. Elements such as buttons, input areas, and displays should be self-explanatory.
-Quality of GUI: The GUI should be responsive, ensuring a consistent and optimal user experience across different screen sizes and resolutions.
-Robust Code: In case of an error, the system should provide clear and meaningful error messages to the user, guiding them on how to address the issue.

-Using 2's compliment, UVSim should handle 6 digits decimal calculation without expanding the word size (4 digits). You need to revise the FR accordingly.
-Load and store move things between memory and accumulator 
-Read and write move things between memory and user 
-Arithmetic operations work with memory and accumulator 
-Branch operations move you within memory
-If there's an error the error message should be easy to understand to the user, and the error should not break the program.
-Commands broken into instruction, mem location, and word
