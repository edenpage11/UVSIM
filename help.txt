Inputting commands: 
    - Commands can be input with the format #### with the first 2 ## being an operation code from the list below
    and the second 2 ## being a reference to a memory location between 00 and 99.
    - Input each command on it's own line
    - Each line should only have 4 digits
    - Use the buttons on the dialpad in the program to input lines of code

Options of commands and their codes: 
    I/O operations:

        READ = 10                       Read a word from the keyboard into a specific location in memory.

        WRITE = 11                     Write a word from a specific location in memory to screen.

    Load/store operations:

        LOAD = 20                      Load a word from a specific location in memory into the accumulator.

        STORE = 21                     Store a word from the accumulator into a specific location in memory.

    Arithmetic operation:

        Add = 30                         Add a word from a specific location in memory to the word in the accumulator (leave the result in the accumulator)

        SUBTRACT = 31             Subtract a word from a specific location in memory from the word in the accumulator (leave the result in the accumulator)

        DIVIDE = 32                    Divide the word in the accumulator by a word from a specific location in memory (leave the result in the accumulator).

        MULTIPLY = 33              multiply a word from a specific location in memory to the word in the accumulator (leave the result in the accumulator).

    Control operation:

        BRANCH = 40                 Branch to a specific location in memory

        BRANCHNEG = 41         Branch to a specific location in memory if the accumulator is negative.

        BRANCHZERO = 42       Branch to a specific location in memory if the accumulator is zero.

        HALT = 43                       Pause the program

Examples: 
    - A line with the input 1001 would request an input from the user and store it in memory location 1
    - A line with 3045 would add whatever value was most recently loaded into the accumulator to the value at memory location 45
    and store it back in the accumulator

Other buttons:
    - Clear
        - Clicking the clear button will clear the code that has been input to the text box
    - New line
        - The user should click the New Line button after 4 digits have been input to create a new line of code
    - Reset memory
        - The reset memory button will clear the memory, accumulator, and reset the program counter
    - Run
        - The run button will run all lines of code
